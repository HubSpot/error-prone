The Java `Serializable` API is very powerful, and very dangerous. Any
consumption of a serialized object that cannot be explicitly trusted will likely
result in a critical remote code execution bug that will give an attacker
control of the application. (See
[Effective Java 3rd Edition ยง84][ej3e-84])

Consider using less powerful serialization methods, such as JSON or XML.
